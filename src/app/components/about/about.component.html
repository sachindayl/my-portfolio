      I Graduated from The Ohio State University - Columbus Campus in December 2016 with a degree in B.S Computer Information Science. As a vivid gamer from my childhood days I wanted to become a software developer. It all started by wanting to learn how make
      computer games. However, the perspective has changed towards making a difference in the world by helping various communities.

        During the weekends I play cricket. I am an active member of the OSU Cricket Team and participate in various leagues in the Midwest. I have participated in US College Cricket Nationals twice (2013-2016).
        When I am not playing cricket, I tend to work on my personal projects. Mobile application development is an area that I have been discovering in the recent years and have been focused on developing Android applications.
        I also love to travel as well as play video games.
